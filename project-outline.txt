1. Business Understanding
Use the tweets provided about Google and Apple products to predict whether
the tweets are either positive, negative, and neutral.

Business problem?
- Build a predictive model that can predict that sentiment of a tweet.
    Use this to identify tweets about products and use EDA to see what 
    people are talking about the most. Not sure yet as to who the stakeholder
    would be considering these are both Apple and Google products. Maybe 
    Samsung can you use this to predict what people are saying about their
    competitors products to better decisions about what to do with theirs.

2. Data Preparation

6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate based on accuracy and F1 Score.
- Which model performed best?
- Does CountVectorizer or TfIdfVectorizer work better?
- GridSearch best model for hyper parameters.
